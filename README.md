# mars-rover
Prework for Ironhack web development course

We are sending a rover to Mars and we need to program its movements so that we can send it commands from Earth. At Ironhack, weâ€™ve been tasked with developing the code for doing so.

This code contains the following -

A function to turn the rover.
A function to move the rover forwards or backwards based on its direction.
A function to receive a list of commands and move based off of those commands.
